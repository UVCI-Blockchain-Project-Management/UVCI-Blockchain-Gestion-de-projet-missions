# Lesson 1

In this lesson we learned basics of blockchain.

Here is your assignment:

- [ ] Create a cosmwasm wallet and address. Save mnemonic somewhere safe. You will be using this address during 
  course.
- [ ] Request tokens to it on `oysternet-1` network. We don't reveal information on how to request, in blockchain 
  finding information is a skill itself :)
- [ ] Find out transaction hash of token request. you can find it here
  https://block-explorer.oysternet.cosmwasm.com/transactions. Use the search bar :)
- [ ] Post your address and faucet request transaction hash back to us.

## Grading

Fill your address to [index.ts/ADDRESS](index.ts) variable.
Test script will check the validity of the address.
